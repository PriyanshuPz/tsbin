## **Development Setup**

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tsbin.git
cd tsbin
```

2. **Install dependencies for frontend**

```bash
cd frontend
bun install
```

3. **Install dependencies for backend**

```bash
cd ../backend
bun install
```

4. **Run development servers**

```bash
# Frontend
bun run dev

# Backend
bun run dev
```

5. **CLI Setup and Usage**

The CLI (Command-Line Interface) allows users to interact with tsbin directly from the terminal,for instance,to upload,encrypt or manage files without using the web UI.

**Location**

The CLI source code is located in the `/packages/cli` directory.

**🛠️Setup Steps**

Navigate to the CLI folder:

```bash
cd packages/cli
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Run the CLI in development mode:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
bun run build
```

**Contributing to the CLI**

- Follow the TypeScript conventions as the main project.

- Test your changes locally using sample commands(eg:bun run tsbin <command>).

- Update CLI usage examples in documentation if you add or modify commands.

---

## **Reporting Issues**

- Use the **GitHub Issues** page.
- Include:

  - Clear description of the problem
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Expected behavior vs actual behavior
  - Environment details (Node version, OS, browser if relevant)

---

## **Submitting Pull Requests**

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
```

3. Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Add brief description of changes"
```

4. Push to your fork:

```bash
git push origin feature/my-feature
```

5. Open a **Pull Request** against `master`.

**Guidelines:**

- Keep commits small and focused.
- Include **tests** or verify functionality when possible.
- Ensure code is **consistent with TypeScript + project style**.
- PR title should be descriptive.
- Include screenshots or GIFs for frontend/UI changes.

---

## **Security and Privacy Guidelines**

- **Do not store unencrypted file contents** in the repository or database.
- Always use **end-to-end encryption** for any file content.
- When handling user data (even anonymous), **do not expose sensitive keys or credentials**.
- Encourage users to **create accounts for enhanced security** if you implement features that involve storing encryption keys.

---

## **Additional Notes**

- tsbin is a collaborative, **open-source project**. Everyone is welcome to contribute.
- For larger features or breaking changes, open an **issue first** to discuss the design.
